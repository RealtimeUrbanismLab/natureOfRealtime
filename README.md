# Nature of RealTime: Interactive Visualizations for DDes Conference 2024

This project is an interactive realtime visualization created for the Harvard GSD DDes Conference 2024: *RealTimeNature*. The workshop *Scales of RealTime*, led by **Farzin Lotfi-Jam**, explores the aesthetics, histories, materiality, and spatial effects of realtime. 

Farzin Lotfi-Jam’s session will examine the intersections of imperialism, time, and space within the context of realtime computation. The interactive visualizations and simulations provided in this repository are designed to investigate various spatial and temporal scales, showcasing how real-time systems mediate and reshape our understanding of urban environments and power structures. These tools serve as a platform for exploring the political, social, and technological implications of realtime in both historical and contemporary settings.

This repository contains p5.js sketches and Leaflet-based visualizations developed for the workshop and conference. 

## Workshop Event Details

**DDes Conference 2024: RealTimeNature**
[RealTimeNature](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/event/ddes-conference-2024-realtimenature/)
- **Date:** September 27, 2024
- **Time:** 9:30 AM – 5:30 PM
- **Location:** GSD, Gund Hall Piper Auditorium
- **Affiliation:** Harvard GSD Design Studies

The conference explores the relationship between technology and nature in the context of the current ecological crisis, with discussions around environmental simulation, remote sensing, and real-time synchronizations. The focus is on how technology reconfigures our understanding of nature and its impact on space and time.

**Key Workshop: Scales of RealTime**
- **Led by:** Farzin Lotfi-Jam
- **Time:** 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM

The interactive visualizations and simulations available in this repository were built to explore different spatial and temporal scales.
